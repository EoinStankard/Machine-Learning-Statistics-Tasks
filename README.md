# Machine-Learning-Statistics-Tasks

## About the Assignment
Four tasks will be listed here at different times during the semester. You should complete all tasks in a single jupyter notebook. This, along with relevant files like a README, should be in a single git repository synced with a hosting provider like GitHub [1]. That URL should then be submitted using the link on the Moodle page.

**1. October 5th, 2020:** Write a Python function called sqrt2 that calculates and prints to the screen the square root of 2 to 100 decimal places. Your code should not depend on  any module from the standard library1 or otherwise. You should research the task first and include references and a description of your algorithm.

**2. November 2nd, 2020:** The Chi-squared test for independence is a statistical hypothesis test like a t-test. It is used to analyse whether two categorical variables are independent. The Wikipedia article gives the table below as an example [4], stating the Chi-squared value based on it is approximately 24.6. Use scipy.stats to verify this value and calculate the associated p value. You should include a short note with references justifying your analysis in a markdown cell.
